Ex 6-3 Describe how you would test freq.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <limits.h>

unsigned long count[UCHAR_MAX+1];
// freq main: display byte freq counts
int main(void)
{
    int c;

    while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
        count[c]++;
    for (c = 0; c < UCHAR_MAX; c++)
        if (count[c] != 0)
            printf("%.2x %c %lu\n",
                c, isprint(c) ? c : '-', count[c]);
    return 0;
}

I would test against files with:
  - only one type of char of known amount
  - all possible chars one of each
  - one char
  - no input
  - one char more times than long can handle
  
and compare the results against expected results.
